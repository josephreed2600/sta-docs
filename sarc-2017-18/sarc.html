				<h1>School Accountability Report Card<br/>
					Reported Using Data from the 2017—18 School Year</h1>
				<address>California Department of Education</address>
			</header>
			<p>By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC).The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/">https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/</a>.</li>

			<h2>Contact Information (School Year 2018&ndash;19)</h2>
			<h2>School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2018&ndash;19)</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					We are a 6th&ndash;8th grade Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) middle school, with a college and career emphasis, located in the heart of California. Our opening day of school was August 21, 2017. There is one class per grade level, with approximately 25 students in each grade. We do not desire to grow, as a key to our program is remaining small and individualized.
				</p>
				<p>
					The mission of Sherman Thomas STEM Academy is to prepare students, through rigorous and relevant content, to be productive and successful citizens by developing strong work ethic and the higher-level critical thinking skills needed to solve problems in the 21st century world.
				</p>
				<p>
					One way that we work towards achieving our mission is through our field trip program. All students attend all field trips together&mdash;a minimum of 3 businesses, 3 colleges, and 1 enrichment (this is another reason we wish to remain at approximately 75 students&mdash;to not overwhelm businesses with our size). A student that goes through our program will end up visiting 9 college campuses before they start high school, allowing them the opportunity to start to visualize themselves there and take away a bit of the mystery of college.
				</p>
